            <h2 className="small-head">Why this works</h2>
            <h1 className="head">Trusted by millions.</h1>
            <p>
              When a Monero transaction is sent, there is no way to see the
              sending party, receiving party, nor the transaction value.
              <br />
              <br />
              By sending Monero from one exchange to another, it vanishes from
              the ledger, then suddenly reappears to a new exchange that has no
              tie to the former.

            <h2 className="small-head">Why we built this</h2>
            <h1 className="head">Decentralization.</h1>
            <p>
              Decentralization and anonymity should go hand-in-hand. Why should
              everyone be able to track where you earn your money and where it
              is spent?
              <br />
              <br />
              Karen across the street doesnâ€™t have access to view your bank
              account, so why should crypto be any different! HoudiniSwap makes
              it easy to swap transactions between wallets without a trace. Bye
              bye nosy neighbors!
